  FlatGem - Bulk AI File Processor for Gemini API 🤖
</h1>

### You're Smart Enough to Use AI. So Why Are You Still Copy-Pasting Files Like a Robot?

You already know the power of AI. You use it to reformat, translate, or summarize your work, saving hours of manual effort. But now you have a folder with **1,000 files**.

Are you seriously going to:

1.  Open file #1.
2.  Copy its content.
3.  Paste it into an AI chat.
4.  Wait for the result.
5.  Copy the result.
6.  Save it to a new file.
7.  ...and then do it all over again **999 times?** 🤯

That's not automation. That's a new kind of digital torture. **Your time is worth more than that.**

## FlatGem is the Missing Piece in Your Workflow 🧩

FlatGem is a dead-simple desktop tool that does one thing, and does it perfectly: it connects the world's most powerful AI models directly to your local file system.

No more copy-pasting. You write your master instruction **once**, select your folders, and click "Start". FlatGem takes over, feeding your files to the AI one by one, automatically.

**Go grab a coffee ☕. Come back to a completed job.**

## Harness the Full Power of Google's AI Ecosystem – For Free 🚀

This isn't some cheap, home-brewed AI. FlatGem gives you direct access to Google's cutting-edge generative models.

Our recommendation? The incredible **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It's a very efficient model, delivering top-tier intelligence at incredible speed – and it's **completely free to use**. But you're not locked in. You can also select from the versatile open-source **Gemma** models or any other model your API key has access to.

## Features Built for a Frustration-Free Workflow ✨

*   **🖥️ Intuitive GUI for Humans:** Forget confusing command-line tools and cryptic config files. FlatGem has a clean, straightforward interface that a child could understand. It’s designed to be used, not to be studied.

*   **🗂️ Built for Bulk Processing:** Designed to chew through thousands of files in one session. The tool itself has no hard limits, but it respects Google's API...

*   **⏰ Smart Rate Limiting:** ...which is why we included a simple delay setting. You can easily adjust the pause between requests to stay within Google's free API limits, ensuring your huge jobs run smoothly without errors.

*   **📜 Your Prompt, Your Rules:** Total control over the system prompt. Make it as simple or as complex as you need.

*   **📁 Preserves Your Structure:** Processes subfolders recursively and perfectly mirrors the directory structure in the output location.

*   **🔒 Secure & Private:** Your API key is your own. It's stored locally on your machine, never shared, never sent anywhere except directly to Google's API.
